We are using CNN models: AlexNet, VGG, Inception. The models need to be training with GPU.

Toolkit & Packages:
Python3.5, Tensorflow(GPU), Keras, numpy, pandas, ScikitLearn, openCV

How to run:
DataSet: Please downloads the dataset from Kaggle.
Training: The models are wrote in jupyter notebook, which can be run directly.
Predict: predict_Planet1.ipynb
